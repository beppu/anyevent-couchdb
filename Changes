    (by Yuval Kogman)
  - use URI->path to set the DB name (no problems with missing leading slash)
    (by Yuval Kogman)

1.05 2008-12-10
  - Regarding RT#41596, I don't want to penalize people who
    were following the docs, so when you say
    $query->({ group => 'false' }) you'll get
    "?group=false" just like before.
    DWIM can be a double-edged sword.  :-(

1.04 2008-12-10
  - RT#41596:  accepted suggestion from bug report to change
    how the $query function deals with the 'group' parameter.
    It now translates between Perl's notion of truth to Javascript's
    formal true/false values implicitly.
