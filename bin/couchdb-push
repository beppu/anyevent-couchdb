=head1 NAME

couchdb-push - push documents from the filesystem to CouchDB

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

  couchdb-push [OPTION]... <FILE>... <COUCHDB_DATABASE>

Pushing a directory of JSON documents to http://localhost:5984/db :

  couchdb-push * db
  couchdb-push * http://localhost:5984/db  # same thing

  # The filenames will be used as document ids
  # However, if a document's _id is set to null, we will let
  #   CouchDB automatically assign an _id.

Pushing one design document to db:

  # The file "_design/comments" must exist in the filesystem.
  couchdb-push _design/comments db

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script will take a list of files and publish them to a CouchDB database.
The filenames will be used as document ids in CouchDB, and slashes in the path
will be escaped properly.  This will let you upload documents that have ids
with '/'s in them (like '_design/docs').

This script was intended to populate a CouchDB database with some initial
documents.
